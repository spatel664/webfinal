            The history of rock paper scissors is a long, winding one. The game has its origins in China, but grew in popularity in Japan and eventually spread across the globe.
            A common belief is that it was invented in the 18th century by a French general named Rochambeau, who was sent to America to help the country become independent from the British..
            It's also a popular pastime in Indonesia, where it's known as semut, orang, gajah. This version of the game is a little more advanced than RPS and can be played with either two fingers or a gun-like gesture.

          <b>THE ROCK:-</b>
          <br>
            The rock is internationally recognized by a closed fist where the thumb is not concealed.
            It is also one of the most popular opening moves and this is why it is considered to be one of the most popular hand signals.
            Most players will view using the rock as an opening move to be somehow aggressive but would still use it because it is easy. 
            The rock will beat scissors every time but will be beaten by paper.

          <b>THE PAPER:-</b>
          <br>
            Paper is delivered in the same way as the rock except that in this case all the fingers and the thumb are extended in a way that they all face the same direction. 
            The vertical paper or the handshake is strictly forbidden in tournaments of Rock Paper Scissors because it might resemble the scissors which can lead to unnecessary confusion. 
            Paper is one of the most challenging opening moves because there is no indication of what you intend to do next. As a result, many players will be concerned when you use it as an opening move to your game. 
            Paper will beat rock but will be beaten by scissors in no time.

          <b>THE SCISSORS:-</b>
          <br>
            Scissors are thrown in the same way as rock where the hand is clenched into a fist but the index and the middle finger are extended to the front in order to make an angle that is of 30 to 45 degrees in a way that would resemble a pair of scissors.
            The use of horizontal scissors is strictly forbidden in tournaments because they can resemble the shape of paper. 
            Opening with scissors is not a very smart move because your opponent will be able to guess what your signal is going to be easily and so will be able to come up with a stronger signal.
